## Document information extraction

GroupDocs.Watermark allows to obtain basic information about source document - file type, size, pages count, page height and width etc.  
This may be quite useful for generating document preview and precise watermark placing inside document.

## Preview document pages

Document preview feature allows to generate image representations of document pages. This may be helpful for better understanding about document content and its structure,  
set proper watermark position inside document, apply appropriate watermark styling etc. Preview can be generated for all document pages (by default) or for specific page numbers or page range.

Supported image formats for document preview are:

*   PNG;
*   JPG;
*   BMP.
